# Neuromorphic Mycelium Chip

We introduce a neuromorphic computing substrate based on PEDOT:PSS-infused mycelium, a biofabricated, morphologically tunable material that can be engineered into electrically active components including resistors, capacitors, and diode-like elements. Leveraging the principles of physical reservoir computing, we demonstrate that mycelium networks grown under controlled environmental conditions can transform time-varying inputs into nonlinear, high-dimensional state trajectories, enabling machine learning tasks such as NARMA-10 sequence prediction.
